cubenumvec and layernumvec: what do they do

secondarypsfcube / vec what do they do






PSF:

create psfgenerator inside dolphin or seperately? do they share libraries/functionalities? perhaps make seperate like cube but include here

see psfgenerator by the people that created deconvolutionlab2, this can also be used for the development of the psf gen algorithms

what to think about:
- is the psf generation computationally expensive?
- gpu?
- input/output format
- how will it be used? standalone?
