- ask zoltan about image extension and padding, why should i pad the psf? makes sense that the cubes are padded

- grid splitting and merging doesnt work, works without

- should not grid images also have padding?

- who should set backend type, setupconfig or deconvconfig

- test refactor with rldeconv

- refactor all other deconv algorithms



GUI:
a event system which lets lower layer windows be able to ocmmunicate with higher level would be nice







cubenumvec and layernumvec: what do they do
 LK these should allow differnt cubes and layers to be deconved with different psfs

secondarypsfcube / vec what do they do
 LK i think these are remains, replaced by cubenumvec to allow arbitrary number of psfs
